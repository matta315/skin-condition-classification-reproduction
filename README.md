# skin-condition-classification-reproduction
A reproduction study examining AI bias in dermatology classification across different skin types using the Fitzpatrick 17k Dataset. Implements VGG-16 based model to evaluate how deep learning performance varies across skin colors, reproducing key findings from Groh et al.'s 2021 paper.

## Project Overview
This reproduction study focuses on evaluating how deep learning models perform in classifying skin conditions across different skin types using the Fitzpatrick 17k Dataset. Our goal is to reproduce the paper's key findings about AI bias in dermatology classification across different skin types.

### Key Components
- Implementation of VGG-16 based classification model
- Analysis across different Fitzpatrick skin types
- Evaluation of model performance on various skin conditions
- Reproduction of key metrics and results

** VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that's widely used for image classification tasks

### Dataset
- Fitzpatrick 17k Dataset
- 16,577 clinical images
- 114 skin conditions
- Annotated with Fitzpatrick skin types
